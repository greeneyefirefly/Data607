#### Background {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset.-pills}
##### Twin on Task
The task of the assignment was to have at least six individuals rate five movies. However, it was not very suitable in my case as those I know very rarely watch movies, so little that they have never seen Black Panther! Yes, this makes me the cool friend. Therefore, I opt for the one thing that we all like watching, that is Korean Popular Music Videos.

***  
##### Overview
K-Pop has become quite a phenomenon in Western society over the last decade. SHINee is one of distinguished boy bands that continues to greatly influence the trends of K-Pop music industry. They debuted as a 5-member group in 2008, and since then has release over 35 music videos.

This assignment seeks to investigate what is the most appealing attribute to fans about 5 random SHINee music videos, and which video has an equal distribution of the attributes based on fans' rankings.

***  
##### MVs
The five music videos that were selected from SHINee's discography are: 
```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
Music_Videos = c("Sherlock", "Everybody","View","Tell Me What To Do", "Good Evening")
mvs<-data.frame(Music_Videos, Released_Date =c(2012,2013,2015,2016,2018))
knitr::kable(mvs)
```

***
#### Methodology {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset.-pills}
##### The Attributes
The music videos were ranked based on these attributes:

1. Visual - the aspects of the music video that appeals strictly to the sense of sight.
2. Theme/Story - how captivating the themes of the music video was depicted or how clear the music video told a story.
3. Performance - how compelling the band/actors were at expressing the concept of the music video.

***  
##### Survey

Utilizing the influence of my social media profile with over 1000 followers, on February 5th, 2019 from 9 AM to 2 PM EST, I announced and made available a link to a *SurveyMonkey* form that allows my followers, nearly 85% of whom are fans of SHINee, to participate in this survey. 

Because the participants are devoted fans, I minimized bias by changing from a 'rating scale' to a 'ranking scale', where the participants are asked to rank the music videos from 1st place to 5th place over 3 attributes. For example, if someone ranks a specific attribute of the music video as **1**, both the ranking spot and music video can no longer be used for the remaining four ranks in this attribute category. A rank in the first spot (**1**) means it is the best for the specific attribute than the others. 

The following is a screenshot of what the survey looks like which allows participants to drag and drop their rankings for each attribute.

#### The Assignment Task {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset.-pills}
##### Data Summary
After the allotted time for responses elapsed, the survey was closed. There were a total of 50 participants. The .csv file was exported from *SurveyMonkey*, and cleaned to be uploaded as a database on MySQL.

***
##### SQL Database
The following code created the database on MySQL.
```{sql eval=FALSE}
-- Samantha Deokinanan
-- CUNY MSDS DATA 607 Assignment 2
-- Database: SHINee Ranking 2/5/2019
-- Host: localhost    
-- ------------------------------------------------------

-- Table structure for contengency table 'SHINeeRanking' 
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `SHINeeRanking`;
CREATE TABLE `SHINeeRanking` (
  `ID` integer NOT NULL,
  `mvs` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `first_visual` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `second_visual` varchar(100) NOT NULL,

  );

-- Dumping data for table `SHINeeRanking`
LOAD DATA INFILE 'path\to\hw2dataset_SHINeeRanking.csv'
INTO TABLE SHINeeRanking
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```

##### Connect to R
Now, it is time to connect R to MySQL database.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Loading the required library 
library(RMySQL)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Connecting to MySQL Sever
db<- dbConnect(MySQL(), user = 'root', password='', dbname = 'shineeranking', host = 'localhost', port=3306)
```

``` {r}
# Retrieving the database and make it avaliable in RStudio
retrieved<- dbSendQuery(db, "SELECT * FROM shineeranking")
SHINeeRanking<- fetch(retrieved, n = -1)
SHINeeRanking<- SHINeeRanking[, -1]
```

```{r}
# The database of the music video ranking
library(kableExtra)
kable(SHINeeRanking) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "200px")
```

***  
##### Format for Use

Using `SHINeeRanking`, the database was separated based on the attributes and converted to matrix form for analysis.
```{r}
# Visual Ranking
visual<-SHINeeRanking[,c(2:6)]
row.names(visual)<-SHINeeRanking$mvs
colnames(visual)<-c("first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth")
visualm<-data.matrix(visual)

# Theme/Story Ranking
theme_story<-SHINeeRanking[,c(7:11)]
row.names(theme_story)<-SHINeeRanking$mvs
colnames(theme_story)<-c("first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth")
theme_storym<-data.matrix(theme_story)

# Performance Ranking
performance<-SHINeeRanking[,c(12:16)]
row.names(performance)<-SHINeeRanking$mvs
colnames(performance)<-c("first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth")
performancem<-data.matrix(performance)
```

#### Results {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset.-pills} 
##### Statistics
I wanted to visualize the nature of the dependence of how each music video rank among a specific attribute. Therefore, chi-squared statistic were used, where this test evaluates whether there is a significant association between the categories.

* Null hypothesis (H0): the row and the column variables of the contingency table are independent.  
* Alternative hypothesis (H1): row and column variables are dependent.

For visualization, `corrplot()` was used. Positive association are displayed in white and negative association in black color. Color intensity and the size of the circle are proportional to the correlation coefficients.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(corrplot)
```

***

##### Visual
Firstly, for *Visual*, the test revealed that the variables are statistically associated, *p-value* < 0. The most contributing cells can be shown below. 

The music videos with the frequent rankings of first place for *Visual* are *Tell Me What To Do* and *Good Evening*. While looking at the music video *Sherlock*, it is clear that it wasn't commonly ranked as *first* or *second* for *Visual*. 

```{r}
chi_visual<-chisq.test(visualm)
chi_visual

corrplot(chi_visual$residuals, col = c("black", "white"), bg = "lightblue", is.cor = FALSE, sig.level = .05)
```

***

##### Theme/Story
Next, the test revealed that the variables for Theme/Story are also statistically associated, *p-value* < 0. The most contributing cells can be shown below by the plot. The music video with the most association ranking of first place for the best theme or story was *Good Evening*. While *Everybody* was frequently ranked fifth place among the music videos.

```{r}
chi_theme<-chisq.test(theme_storym)
chi_theme

corrplot(chi_theme$residuals, col = c("black", "white"), bg = "lightblue", is.cor = FALSE, sig.level = .05)
```

***

##### Performance
Lastly, the chi-squared test revealed that the variables are statistically associated, *p-value* < 0. The most contributing cells can be shown below. The *Performance* attribute of the music videos were mostly associated with *Sherlock* and *Everybody*. While it is clear that *Tell Me What To Do* and *Good Evening* were commonly associated as *fifth* place.

```{r}
chi_pref<-chisq.test(performancem)
chi_pref

corrplot(chi_pref$residuals, col = c("black", "white"), bg = "lightblue", is.cor = FALSE, sig.level = .05)
```

***
#### Conclusion
In conclusion, the music video that does not appear to be frequently ranked as outstanding to have one of the three attributes was *View*. It was close to a even rank on *Visual*, ranked often as *second* and *third* for *Theme/Story*, and often ranked *third* for *Performance*. This may suggest that fans believe that *View* is well-balanced on *Visual*, *Theme/Story* and *Performance* with no attribute being distinctively impressive over the next. Whereas, *Good Evening* was mostly associated with both *Visual* and *Theme/Story*, and *Sherlock* was mostly associated with the *Performance* attribute.
